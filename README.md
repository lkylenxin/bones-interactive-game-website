## Summary
We ended up making a cute tiny interactive game where a player needs to collect ten bones around the doghouse. So he could exchange them for a new toy for his puppy. The players can either use the arrow keys on their computer or click on the mock keys on the screen to control our protagonistâ€™s movement to navigate the world within a top-down camera view and collect the bones. To succeed, players need to pay attention to the instruction banner above the frame as it changes along the process.

## Original Plan
At first, we planned to imitate the game tower defense. We wanted to have a cannon at the center of the frame, rotating and firing at spots invading and coming at it. Below is a small experiment where we created a red cube following the cursor when building the rotating cannon.
